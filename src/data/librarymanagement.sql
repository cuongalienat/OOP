First, achieving sustainability requires socio-technical transitions that entail new technologies, production processes, lifestyles, and consumption patterns. Second, firms play crucial roles in mediating between sustainable production and consumption. Third, radical innovations require organizational innovations and new business models. Peter Wells successfully combines these big picture ideas with rich in-depth case studies drawing on years of accumulated expertise. Highly recommended. Frank W. Geels, University of Manchester, UK and Chairman of the Sustainability Transitions Research Network With increasing awareness that innovative technology alone is insufficient to make sustainable lifestyles a reality, this book brings into sharp focus the need to create radical new business models. This insightful book provides a theoretically grounded but also realistic account of how the design of business models can be a critical component in the overall transition to sustainability, and one that transcends the usual focus on innovative technology. Weaving together key principles and components for business sustainability, the book highlights five very different pathways to the future for sectors ranging from microbreweries and printing through to clothing, mobility and plastics. Business has only just started the first few tentative steps towards a very different approach to creating and sustaining value, but this book concludes that enormous opportunities will emerge alongside new ways of creating and capturing value.

The growing internationalization of sports inevitably increases the weight of global regulation, yet each country maintains its own distinct regime of sports law and its own national and local sports organizations. Sports law at a national or organizational level thus gains a growing relevance in comparative law. The book describes and discusses both state-created rules and autonomous self-regulation regarding the variety of economic, social, commercial, cultural, and political aspects of sports activities. Self- regulation manifests itself in the form of by-laws, and encompasses organizational provisions, disciplinary rules, and rules of play. However, the trend towards more professionalism in sports and the growing economic, social and cultural relevance of sports have prompted an increasing reliance on legal rules adopted by public authorities. This form of regulation appears in a variety of legal areas, including criminal law, labour law, commercial law, tax law, competition law, and tort law, and may vary following a particular type or sector of sport. It is in this dual and overlapping context that such much-publicized aspects as doping, sponsoring and media, and responsibility for injuries are legally measured. This monograph fills a gap in the legal literature by giving academics, practitioners, sports organizations, and policymakers access to sports law at this specific level. Lawyers representing parties with interests in Ireland will welcome this very useful guide, and academics and researchers will appreciate its value in the study of comparative sports law.'),(1279286504,'Education','Getting Started with English Language Learners','Judie Haynes',7,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vgtRBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','\"It\'s been six months, and I STILL can\'t get my English language learners to participate in class!\" \"How can I help my newcomers feel more comfortable around other students?\" \"Am I doing enough to help my English language learners succeed?\" Have you had these thoughts?

Soccer robotics has become an important research area integrating mechatronics, computer science and artificial intelligence techniques to create real-world autonomous systems. It also serves as a popular test arena in which to compare the different approaches, in diverse types of competition and with varying levels of distributed perception and collaboration. The focus of this monograph is the FIRA framework of Soccer Robotics, in particular MiroSot, which uses a central overhead camera to overview the whole soccer field and a central control of the robots. \"Soccer Roboticsâ€� completely describes the different requirements to create a soccer team and details the hardware aspects, the computer vision needed, navigation, action selection, basic skills and game strategy. These aspects are described at an undergraduate level, resulting in a book not only useful as a text for courses but also indispensable for everyone who wants to participate in MiroSot robotics.'),(1863477548,'Medical','Financial and Business Management for the Doctor of Nursing Practice','KT Waxman, DNP, MBA, RN, CNL, CENP, CHSE, FSSH, FAAN, FAONL',7,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sCq5NasfGYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Awarded second place in the 2013 AJN Book of the Year Awards in the Advanced Practice Nursing category Ã¬Finally, a definitive financial management book geared to nursing professionals who need to know health care finance in non-CPA terms.

I discuss how the issue of language is at the centre of the current cultural and political debates in Morocco. The present book is an investigation of the ramifications of multilingualism for language choice patterns and attitudes among Moroccans. More importantly, the book assesses the roles played by linguistic and cultural factors in the development and evolution of Moroccan society. It also focuses on the impact of multilingualism on cultural authenticity and national identity. Having been involved in research on language and culture for many years, I am particularly interested in linguistic and cultural assimilation or alienation, and under what conditions it takes place, especially today that more and more Moroccans speak French and are influenced by Western social behaviour more than ever before. In the process, I provide the reader with an updated description of the different facets of language use, language maintenance and shift, and language attitudes, focusing on the linguistic situation whose analysis is often blurred by emotional reactions, ideological discourses, political biases, simplistic assessments, and ethnolinguistic identities.'),(2076945504,'Sports','The Badminton Magazine of Sports and Pastimes','Alfred Edward Thomas Watson',3,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FGjj37EjNzYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','No description available.'),(2105135927,'California','Journal of the Senate, Legislature of the State of California','California.
